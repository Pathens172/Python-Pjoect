# Python-Pjoect

Weather App
This is a Python-based Weather Application that fetches real-time weather data for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app handles various scenarios, including city name errors, no internet connection, and API timeouts.

Features
Fetch current weather conditions for a specific city.
Displays the temperature, weather description, and city name.
Handles errors for:
Invalid city names.
No internet connection.
API timeouts and other unexpected issues.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Requests library for making HTTP requests.
OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data.
Requirements
Python 3.x
requests library (for making API calls)
Setup Instructions
Step 1: Install Python
If you don't have Python 3 installed on your system, download and install it from the official Python website.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies (optional but recommended).

Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv weather_env
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\weather_env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source weather_env/bin/activate
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests
Step 3: Get Your OpenWeatherMap API Key
Sign up on OpenWeatherMap and obtain your API key.
Replace the API_KEY variable in the script (main.py) with your personal API key.
Step 4: Run the Application
In the terminal, navigate to the project directory.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
The app will prompt you to enter a city name. Type the name of the city (e.g., London), and it will fetch and display the weather.

Error Handling
The app handles the following scenarios gracefully:

Invalid City Name: If the city name entered is incorrect, the app will display:

javascript
Copy code
Error: City not found. Please check the name and try again.
No Internet Connection: If there is no internet connection, the app will display:

javascript
Copy code
Error: No internet connection. Please check your network and try again.
API Timeout: If the API request times out, the app will display:

csharp
Copy code
Error: The request timed out. Please try again later.
Unexpected Errors: Any other unexpected errors will be caught, and the app will display a relevant error message.

Future Improvements
Add weather forecasts (hourly/daily).
Improve the user interface (GUI or web-based).
Allow users to choose temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
Add additional weather details like wind speed, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times.
