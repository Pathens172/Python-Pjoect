# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built with Python and Tkinter that allows users to get the current weather information for any city. The app connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. Users can choose the unit for temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.

## Features

- **Get current weather data**: Input a city name to retrieve the current weather for that city.
- **Unit selection**: Choose between Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin for temperature units.
- **Error handling**: The app shows appropriate error messages if something goes wrong, such as invalid city names or API errors.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using Python's Tkinter library, the app has a user-friendly interface.

## Installation

1. **Install Python**: This app requires Python 3.x. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
   - Download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install the required libraries**: You need to install the `requests` and `tkinter` libraries.
   - You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```
   - `tkinter` is included by default with Python, so you don't need to install it separately.

3. **Get an OpenWeatherMap API key**:
   - Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account.
   - After signing up, get your API key from the API section.
   - Replace the placeholder `API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.

## Usage

1. **Run the app**: Open the terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run the script with Python:
   ```bash
   python weather_app.py
   ```

2. **Input the city name**: Type in the name of the city you want to get the weather for.

3. **Select a temperature unit**: Choose between Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), or Kelvin (K).

4. **View the weather**: Click the "Get Weather" button, and the app will display the current weather for the city, including:
   - City name
   - Temperature (in the selected unit)
   - Weather description (e.g., clear sky, rain)
   - Humidity percentage
   - Wind speed (in meters per second)

## Error Handling

The app will display error messages if:
- No city is entered.
- An invalid city name is entered.
- The selected temperature unit is invalid.
- The API request fails due to network issues or invalid API keys.

## Example

### Running the app:
1. Open the app and type `"London"` in the city input box.
2. Select `"C"` for Celsius.
3. Click "Get Weather" to see the current weather in London (e.g., 15Â°C, cloudy, humidity 78%, wind speed 3 m/s).

## Screenshots

Include some screenshots of your app here (if you have them).

## Future Improvements (Optional)

- Add a **5-day weather forecast**.
- Show a **loading spinner** while waiting for the API response.
- **Improved error handling** based on different status codes from the API.
