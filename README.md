# Python-Project

Weather App
This is a simple weather application built with Python and Tkinter that allows users to get the current weather information for any city. The app connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. Users can choose the unit for temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.

Features
Get current weather data: Input a city name to retrieve the current weather for that city.
Unit selection: Choose between Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin for temperature units.
Error handling: The app shows appropriate error messages if something goes wrong, such as invalid city names or API errors.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using Python's Tkinter library, the app has a user-friendly interface.
Installation
Install Python: This app requires Python 3.x. Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Download it from here.
Install the required libraries: You need to install the requests and tkinter libraries.

You can install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install requests
tkinter is included by default with Python, so you don't need to install it separately.
Get an OpenWeatherMap API key:

Go to OpenWeatherMap and sign up for a free account.
After signing up, get your API key from the API section.
Replace the placeholder API_KEY in the code with your actual API key.
Usage
Run the app: Open the terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run the script with Python:

bash
Copy code
python weather_app.py
Input the city name: Type in the name of the city you want to get the weather for.

Select a temperature unit: Choose between Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), or Kelvin (K).

View the weather: Click the "Get Weather" button, and the app will display the current weather for the city, including:

City name
Temperature (in the selected unit)
Weather description (e.g., clear sky, rain)
Humidity percentage
Wind speed (in meters per second)
Error Handling
The app will display error messages if:

No city is entered.
An invalid city name is entered.
The selected temperature unit is invalid.
The API request fails due to network issues or invalid API keys.
Example
Running the app:
Open the app and type "London" in the city input box.
Select "C" for Celsius.
Click "Get Weather" to see the current weather in London (e.g., 15Â°C, cloudy, humidity 78%, wind speed 3 m/s).
Screenshots
Include some screenshots of your app here (if you have them).

Future Improvements (Optional)
Add a 5-day weather forecast.
Show a loading spinner while waiting for the API response.
Improved error handling based on different status codes from the API.
